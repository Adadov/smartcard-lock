# GNOME Smartcard Lock

GNOME Shell Extention that looks for smartcards, and immediately locks the screen if one of them is removed using **org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard.Token** interface.

Since there is no GUI, I can only provide a screenshot of the log file:

## Future
- maybe specify which smartcards to look at


## Special thanks:

- [Andy Holmes](https://github.com/andyholmes) for very helpful hints and written documentation that allowed someone like me (with pratically zero JavaScript experience) to write a GNOME Shell Extension.
