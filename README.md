# gnome-smartcard-lock

GNOME Shell Extention that looks for smartcards, and immediately locks the screen if one of them is removed using **org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard.Token** interface.

## Future
- maybe specify which smartcards to look at


# Special thanks:

- [Andy Holmes](https://github.com/andyholmes) for very helpful hints and written documentation that allowed someone like me (with pratically zero JavaScript experience) to write a GNOME Shell Extension.
