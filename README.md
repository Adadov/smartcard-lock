# Smartcard Lock for GNOME

This is a GNOME Shell Extention that looks for smartcards, and immediately locks the screen if one of them is removed using **org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Smartcard.Token** interface.

Since there is no GUI, I can't provide a screenshot! :)

But there's a screenshot of a development release in debug mode which does provide some logging:

## Future
- maybe specify which smartcards to look at
